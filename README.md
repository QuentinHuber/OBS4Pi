## Description

This script [builds and install](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19753078/what-is-building-and-installing) [FFmpeg (n4.3.2)](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) and [OBS Studio (26.1.2)](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). Derives and copypasta from different scripts that I have found but unfortunately they did not run successfully. This script may not work tomorrow or next week, so feel free to open a ticket issue to let me know.

## Installation

Before running the script you must upgrade the currently Raspberry Pi OS *Buster* version to the not yet released *Bullseye*. This [tutorial](https://raspberrytips.com/update-raspberry-pi-latest-version/) explains the basic steps 
of how to do it. If you found issues during the upgrade phase check it out the troubleshooting section of that step by step tutorial: [Manually upgrade Debian from Buster to Bullseye](https://doc.akito.ooo/books/essentials/page/manually-upgrade-debian-from-buster-to-bullseye).
