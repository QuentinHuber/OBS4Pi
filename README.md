# OBS4Pi. Installing FFMPEG and OBS Studio for the Raspberry Pi 4 ![Build failed](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-failed-red)

## Introduction

This script is an attempt for building FFMPEG and OBS Studio on a Raspberry Pi 4. It grabs and copypasta from other building scripts I found but running without success.

If you're interested on this topic I suggest you to read this interesting thread, [OBS Raspberry Pi Build Instructions](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-raspberry-pi-build-instructions.115739/). It includes a lot of comments with suggestions to solve most of the problems you'll found (also unsolved mine!).

Maybe this script will not work on a future or next week, so do feel free to open an issue to warning me.

## Cygwin + headless Raspberry Pi 4

Additionally you can read some information for running OBS Studio on a headless raspy using cygwin:

## Some minor issues to take care of

Finally, if you're editing this script under dos environment, you'll get this error related to EOL.
