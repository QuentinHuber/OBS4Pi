# OBS4Pi. Installing FFMPEG and OBS Studio for the Raspberry Pi 4 ![Build passed](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passed-green)

This script is an attempt for building FFMPEG (n4.3.2) and OBS Studio (26.1.2) on a Raspberry Pi 4. It grabs and copypasta from other building scripts I found but 
running without success.

Before you run the script you must upgrade the currently Raspberry Pi OS *Buster* version to the not yet released *Bullseye*. This [tutorial](https://raspberrytips.com/update-raspberry-pi-latest-version/) explains the basic steps 
of how to do it.

If you're interested on this topic I suggest you to read this interesting thread, [OBS Raspberry Pi Build Instructions](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/obs-raspberry-pi-build-instructions.115739/). It includes a lot of comments and suggestions to help to build OBS on a Raspberry Pi.

Maybe this script will not work tomorrow or next week, so do feel free to open an issue to warning me.
